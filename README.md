# Rock-Classification---Decoding-the-earths-palette

This project analyzes rock images from the '360 Rocks' dataset using dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA, t-SNE, LLE, and MDS to explore clustering and feature extraction. It involves determining the number of components to preserve variance, visualizing image clusters, and comparing image embeddings with human-generated features. Additionally, a neural network is trained to classify the images, with a focus on evaluating performance and generating new rock images.
